## About

This capstone project, created for the University of the Assumption, is a complete application that uses ChatGPT from OpenAI as its main feature. It is designed to help students and other university members easily get the information they need.

## API 

The project is created in 2023 and the API key has probably expired or ran out of credits. As a backup it uses the free tier of OpenAI. This allows it to only answer 1 inquiries per minute because of the underlying railguards on the knowledge bank.

# How to run

To run the application, you need to have nodejs installed in your device as well as git.

1. Clone the repo

2. Run: npm install

3. Run: npm run dev
